# PDFGpt
A streamlit application where one can upload any PDF and ask any questions related to the PDF. The web application anwers the query. I have used Python, Streamlit, OpenAI and langchain for implementing the same. 

I am not uploading the .env file because it contains my private OpenAI API key.
